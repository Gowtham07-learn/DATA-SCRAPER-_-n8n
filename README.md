# DATA-SCRAPER-_-n8n
This project uses n8n to automatically scrape data from web pages and extract structured information such as article titles, image URLs, publish dates, and metadata. The workflow leverages JavaScript code nodes to parse HTML content and transform it into clean, usable JSON data.
